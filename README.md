# Expanded Entity Armor Model
## What does the Resource Pack does?
This Resource pack turns on certain parts from the **[Entity]_inner_armor.JEM** that vanilla hides, to be specific the arms and head (plus the headwear)
This uses the CEM animations to just turn on these changes, and because these are parts that vanilla just doesn't use, resource packs that change the armor textures should have no change at all.


The Pack allows you to create things like gloves or something like the Maid armor for my [Resource Pack,](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/spectrumcraft-pack) which also includes these models
The Resource Pack also includes a Template armor that can be used with CIT
Of course, the Resource Pack itself Requires the [EMF Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features)

## How does it work?
The Outer Armor uses the legs for the boots, the arms and chest for the chestplate and the head & headwear for the helmet
However, Inner Armor just uses the legs and chest for the leggings, so this resource pack just allows you to texture these parts too
