# Expanded Entity Armor Model
## What does the Resource Pack does?

Vanilla uses 2 models for armor models:

**[entity]_outer_armor.JEM** for the helmet, chestplate and boots, these models show all the parts/cubes in it: right/left legs, right/left arms, body, head, and headwear.

**[entity]_inner_armor.JEM** for the leggings, this only shows the right/left legs and the body, but for some reason it vanilla hides the rest: right/left arms, head, and the headwear.

This Resource Pack turns on these parts, and adjusts the heads to not interfere with the player skin, however this isn't the only thing it does, it also adjusts the armor model to fit better with the slim player and all other entities that can wear armor in vanilla (anyone can suggest me an entity for a mod in the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SanguardMC/Expanded-Entity-Armor-Model/issues)

The entity changes are made so they don't break other resource packs that add other armor textures, you can use the models in the pack. However, I'd highly appreciate it if you included a link to this pack, as it required a lot of effort to re-model the JEM files with the correct UV without breaking everything.

## How can it be used?

The Pack allows you to create things like gloves or something like the Maid armor for my [Resource Pack,](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/spectrumcraft-pack) which also includes these models
The Resource Pack also includes a Template armor that can be used with [CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn)

You can use the Armor Template [Blockbench model](https://github.com/SanguardMC/Expanded-Entity-Armor-Model/releases/tag/BB-Model) on the GitHub Repository, or you have the armor template armor that's inside the pack and the model:

Red/Green is the outer layer, while the Blue/Yellow is the inner layer

## Dependencies

You'll only require [Entity Model Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) in order to work, but I'd recommend CIT Resewn if you want to add armor to your resource pack and use the template armor

As far as I'm concerned, Optifine doesn't support entity armor CEM models, so I'm not sure if it works
